# Pert-Chart
The PERT chart and Gantt chart serve distinct purposes in project management, each offering unique advantages for planning and tracking. The PERT chart focuses on task dependencies and the relationships between them, using nodes and arrows to illustrate the sequence in which tasks must be completed. This chart is particularly useful for complex projects as it highlights the critical path, which is vital for understanding how delays in certain tasks can impact the overall project timeline. In contrast, the Gantt chart provides a visual representation of tasks along a timeline, showcasing their start and end dates and allowing for easy tracking of progress. It emphasizes scheduling and is often more user-friendly, making it accessible for team members who need a straightforward way to manage resources and deadlines. While the PERT chart is better suited for analyzing intricate dependencies and estimating durations under uncertainty, the Gantt chart excels in monitoring task progress and ensuring timely completion. Ultimately, the choice between these charts depends on the complexity of the project and the specific needs of the team, as both tools can complement each other in effective project management.
